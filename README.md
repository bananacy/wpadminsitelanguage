# wpadminsitelanguage
A WordPress plugin to set the dashboard "site" language based on user preference.

A very basic plugin that allows admins to choose a Site Language from their profile page.
This is useful if you are running a foreign language website and have setup the default site language under Settings > General but need to use the dashboard in another language. 
Normally you would use the inbuilt Language selector under your user profile, however some  multi-lingual plugins use the 'site language' setting in the backend making it hard to administer.

This Plugin ensures your dashboard thinks you are running a different language site! Only affects admin area.

Applies to your account only.

Only affects admin area not frontend.

No settings.

Just activate and go to your Profile page and scroll down to Dashboard Site language and pick a language ( must be preinstalled) .#

Enjoy!


How to install:

Download the php file, compress it as zip and upload/install in wordpress.
